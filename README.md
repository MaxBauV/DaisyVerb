# DaisyVerb
Reverb algorithms for the Daisy Seed

# Audio Samples
Mono and stereo audio samples of reverberators in action included. Audio files appended with a '1' demonstrate the Dry/Wet parameter, while those appended with a '2' demonstrate the feedback gain parameter.    
Original audio of files appended with a...    
'1': [Round Midnight by Wes Montgomery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMhMiBxuqkg)   
'2': [Flash In The Pan by Against All Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaSEOVulOY0)   

# Important note
Code relies on the Daisy Seed's analog pins A0, A1, A2, and A3. The hardware set-up for each one is a potentiometer wiping between 3.3V and GND.

# Schematic & PCB
During the process of writing these reverb algorithms I made a simple dev board to avoid the troubles of working on a breadboard. The daisyboard.sch and daisyboard.brd are schematic and PCB files made in EAGLE. These were designed with consideration of certain PCB fabrication limitations at [The Hive Makerspace](https://hive.ece.gatech.edu), such as no through-hole plating.
