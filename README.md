# Important note
Code relies on the Daisy Seed's analog pins A0, A1, A2, and A3. The hardware set-up for each one is a potentiometer wiping between 3.3V and GND.

# Schematic & PCB
During the process of writing these reverb algorithms I made a simple dev board to avoid the troubles of working on a breadboard. The daisyboard.sch and daisyboard.brd are schematic and PCB files for it. They were made using EAGLE with consideration of the limitations for PCB fabrication at The Hive Makerspace at Georgia Tech, such as no through-hole plating.
