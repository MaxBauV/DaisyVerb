# DaisyVerb
Reverb algorithms for the Daisy Seed


# Important note
Code relies on the Daisy Seed's analog pins A0, A1, A2, and A3. The hardware set-up for each one is a potentiometer wiping between 3.3V and GND.


# PCB & Schematic
daisyboard.sch and daisyboard.brd are schematic and PCB files for a simple dev board. They were made using EAGLE with consideration of the limitations for PCB fabrication at The Hive Makerspace at Georgia Tech, such as no through-hole plating.
